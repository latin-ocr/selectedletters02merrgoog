to take possession of his new office. Pliny mentions else-
where (11. 1. 8‚—Sel. 15) that the aged and famous Verginius
Rufus never failed to come from his retirement in the country

, to attend him upon such occasions, and that another aged
and famous man, Corellius Rufus, hed always been equally
scrupulosa (rr. 17. 6). Pliny himself, too, is at great peius
to apologiae to one of bis friends for being unable to return,
apparently from Umbria, in time to render him this courtesy
(nr. 37). Of. Mommsen Staatsr. 1.8 6163 Friedliinder Sitten-

was held at this time ior an entire year, dating from the first
day of January (Mommsen Stantem 11.³904; 1.' 599), the date
oi this maeting with Regulus is readily fixed as Jan. 1, 97.

the word in the letters (and it occure so ten times there), ex·

when it means his ‘reign ’ ; cf. Ν. 11. 6 (Sel. 32) n. saeculam.
