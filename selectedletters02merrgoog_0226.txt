The charms of country life should be a stimulus to study.-
Caninius Rufus, to whom the letter is addressed, seems to have
been a literary men, s cifioally a poet, and a man of wealth,
if we may judge fromt eletters wntten hy Pliny to him, or to
a Caninius (without the myomneu) whom there is, however, no
resson to believe another man. In 11. 8 he is still enjoying
retirement on the Lacus Larius. In vin. 4 (Sel. 56) he is
plauning an epic poem on the Dacian War, and in IX. 33 (Sel.
69) Pliny sends him a true story to serve as a subjectior
poetioal com sition. In 111. 7 (Sel. 25) and v1. 21 Pliny
writes him t e latest news about two other poets; aud
finally in vn. 18 advises him about the safest way in which to
leave a large endowment to provide public dinners for the
citizens of Comum.

of the western arm of the Lacus Larius (Lago di Come), about
thirty miles north of Mediolanium (Milan). Julius Caesar
lanted a colony there in 59 uu, calling the lace Nouum
domum, and from his day, despite temporary embarrassments
through the machinatione of his political foes, the prosperity
of the town seems to have been assured. It was Pliny’s
native place, es well as the home of his wife Calpurnia (see
IV. 19‚-sel. 34); within its territory he owned extensive
domeins, to it he frequently returned, and for the welfare oi
its people he established various beneficences.
