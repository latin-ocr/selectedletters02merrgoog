INTRODUOTION. xlvii

111. From before the time of Ratherius (esaan),
bishop oi Verona, a manuscript oi Pliny's Letters
containing eight books had been lying in the-cathedral
’ chapter-library of that city.1 It was studied and
excerpted in the second decade of the fourteenth “
century by Iohannes de Matociis (author oi a still
unprinted Historia imperialis, and of a Breuis
adnotatio de dnobus Pliniis), and by the anonymous
Veronese compilor (in 1329) of Floras moralium
auctmitatam manime utilitatis et Ῑωιιοιίι. A century
later Guarino Guarini somehow captured the manu-
script, and by his efforts and those oi his friends and
followers, made it widely known in Italy, and appar-
ently to some extentalso north of the Alps. Guarino,
however, boldly emended and interpolated it, from
conjecture and iram the F-tradition, before he would
let a copy out oi his hands. , The Veroneseoriginal
vanished, no man knows how or whither. As a
consequence, almost all of the many copies that were
spread abroad in the fifteenth century, and still exist
in large numbers, are more or less contaminated in
both the ways mentioned. Two manuscripts only
(D and m) are known to me which apparently were
copied from Veronensis before interpolation corrupted
its testimony. One of these (D) is in the Library at
Dresden (‘ D 166 '), the other (m) in St. Mark's
Library at Venice (‘ Marc. lat. class. ιιι. no. 37 ').
D alone is a complete transcript of Veronensis,
