INTRODUCTION. xv

Pliny, indeed, is the only writer of the time who
affords us any great help in our search, and he within
hut a limited field. For he was born out ol the
level of the great populace that made Rome, and he
lached the adventurous spirit of philosophie initiative
that might have carried him away from the level of
his birth to study the lives of others. He enjoyed
lile so thoroughly within the narrow range of the

company of his peers as never to feel its limitatione.
Indead, the time of sooiology as a science—-or as

a religion—was not yet. Most men were too much
occupied in the external pleasures of their new-
horn summer to think very gravely or study very
deoply.

Pliny-often called the Younger (mico) to dis
tinguish him from his uncle, the author of the
Natural History1-was not born in Rome. He was
a native of Comum, son ofa certain L. Caecilius
L. f. Cilo,² who apparently died while yet a young
man, aiter filling the office ol qualismata aedilis⁸ in
his municipality. These who like may imagine that
he was therefore connected by blood with that
ancihus of Comum who was a· friend of the poet
Catullus, and himself a poet.4 Phny was born
within the last four months of 61 an, or the first eight
of 623 for he tells us⁶ that he was in his eighteenth
, year at the time of that great eruption of Vesuvius
that destroyed Pompeii (Aug. 24, 79). Το his
