INTRODUUPION. xxiii

Between? the tribunate and the praetorship Pliny

did not have to wait the usual year, for the emperor's
special grace relieved him of that otherwise legal
necessity.¹ He therefore became praetor almost
immediately (on danuary 1, 93) upon laying down
the tribunatc, and continued therein for that year
which marked Domitian's attempt to crush the Stoic
opposition the imitation, and as the emperor thought
the danger, of which had then reached its culmination.
Among Pliny’s warm personal friends were many of
the prominent men of that ‘opposition' Whether he
tried to do, or could have done, anything to save
them from their fate is doubtful. He had notin his
constitution the stuff that martyre are made of, and
the only thing ho can point to at a later date as an act
in assistance of his persecuted friends is the accom-
modation with a sum of money and with the

sympathy of a personal visit (but outside of the city) ’
of the philosopher Artemidorus, against whom per·
sonally no action was directed.² Pliny's friendship,
therefore, cost him little, though he tries, not very
successfnlly, to make out in after years that he was
himself then and later in great danger.⁸ But the
facts seem to be against his contentiori. He had been
adwanced by Domitian's special favour3 he was discreet
enough to keep reasonably quiet during his praetor·
ship,⁴ except for the first of his great legal cases before
the senate, the impeachment of Baebius Massa ;ὅ and
