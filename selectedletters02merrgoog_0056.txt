printed the entire book from the first edition oi Aldus,

’ with emendations oi his own. He falsely proiessed
to have a transoript (for x. 1-40) oi a German us. as
his basis.1 From that date until Keil's labours began,
little was done with the text oi Book x., except by
the way oi conjectural emendation, though Orelli
deserves honourable mention.

But Budaeus had acquired a copy oi the edition ·
printed by Avantius‚ and eompleted it by prefixing
a transoript from Parisinus oi Letters i.·xxvi· (1-40 in
our enumeration). He corrected this in a iew plaoes
with his own hand, and throughout the printed text
inserted many readings, chiefly from Parisinus, as he
had dona with the Beroaldus text of Books 1.·1x.
'l'his copy of Book x. forms the seoond part oi the
Bodleian volume referred to above (p. xliii), and is tha
best authority ior the text oi the Trajan correspond-
ence. My own study and oollation oi the Bodleian
book was not made until 1906, four years after this
volume oi Selections was printed. I have been there-
fore unable to include any readings from it in the
uario lectio for the letters from books 1.-1x.: a lew ·

readings are given on Book x. (as from 0) on the
authority of ΜΓ. Hardy. ’
