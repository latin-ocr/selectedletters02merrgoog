INTRODUUI'ION. xvii

Rome of earlier days, such as were traits oi his mind
later in lile.

But if Verginius was not likely to lurnish him with
the highest intellectual stimulus, that was not lacking
in his formative years. His mother’s brother, Ο.
Plinius Secundus, also a native oi Comum, was pre
eminently a bookworm. He was also a man of
wealth, and an active man of affairs. Very few men
could combine these three characteristios as he did.
He had entered public life at an early date, and
vfinally rose through rancus procuratorshipe to the
intimate friendfflp of Vespasium and one ol the
highest positione in the equestrian curam turmam, the

prefecture of the fleat of Misenum. His learning was
immense, his studiousness prodigious, and his literary

'style something to be shuddered st. But oi this last
point his nephew was, and apparently continued to
be, happily oblivious. Indeed, there are some
indications that he may have eontented himself with
admiring his uncle's colossal works instead of reading
them,l ior which he surely ought tc be pardoned.
How much he lived under hie uncle's eye end tutelage
cannot be determined, but some things may be
guessed. There ere no indicatione that he resided
much with Verginius, who, indeed, seems to have
lived in marked seclusion in the country during the
later part of his life, where a bey oi position could
hardly be brought up conveniently and well. More-
0ver Pliny shows in every line and feature oi his

being, in every trait of his character and habits, the
