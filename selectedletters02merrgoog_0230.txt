4. l. NOTES. Ιώ

—This letter is, with one exception (n 12-8018), the only

oue of the first book to whicha date cau be assigned within a
small limit of time. It was written within only a lew
months aiter the murder ol Domitian, but later than Jau. l,
97. The emperor¹ is dead (ἕ l), the new annual magistrates
have entered upon office (511), but Iunius Mauricus, one ol the
political exiles ol Domitian’s reign, though pppbably already
recalled by Nerva, has not yet arrived in me (δέ 10, 15,
16). Thai he vvas periectly reestablished iu Rome before the
death (ἐὲ NSeeera is certain from the aueodote narrated ol him
in IV. ( 35).

1 uculo: M. Aquilius Regulus aehieved a precocicus
reputatiou as a voluutary informer iu the last years oi Nero's ,
reign (see 111. 7. 3,-Sel. 25,-n pones mutuasse), aud upon
the accession 01 Vespasian was reseued from veugeanee only
by the efforts of his younger and better brother, Vipstanus
Messalla (see Tae. Hist. Ν. 42). There seems to be uo
evidence that he prosecuted the trade oi informer under
Domitian, in spite of Pliny's virulenoe against him in this
letter, which seems to have been aroused chiefly by the pout
mortem attach made by Re lus, as a firm supporter ol
Domitian, upon Pliny's rever friends, Rusticus aud Senecio.
Whatever Mauricus may havo advised on his return (510),-
aud it ‘was probably promentium—Nerva after the first was
unlavourable to a revival oi old lenda by a uew batch oi pro·
secutious (see1v. 22,·-Sel. 35), and Regulus cousequeutly
escaped Pliny's dreaded attach, and seems to have lived on
fairly good terma with him up to the time ol the death ol
Regulus in perhaps 105 or soon thereafter (see vr. 2,-801. 41).
The popularity and power of Regulus as au orator are evident
even from Pliny’s criticisms upon him (see 1. 20. 14 ff.,-Sel.
13 ; Ν. 7. 4ff.,—Sel. 313 VI. a-Sel 41), and Martial exalta
him as the equal of Cicero, quite aa he does Pliny himself ;
cl. 111. 21 (Sel. 29) with Mart. 1v. 163 V. 28, 63; VI. 64. 11.
Martianus Capella apparently joins Regulus with Pliny (per-
haps also with others 2²) as consummate oratore 01 the age
(v. 432). Regulus is the oul living man ol whom Pliny iu
his letters speaks sha ly, an the case against him for very
deoided delinqueneyo character iu his maturo years appears
to be not proven.
